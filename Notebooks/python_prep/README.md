# Python

In this directory, I will put materials you can study and soem external references for studying python rather than much of other explations. You must install python first (e.g., Anaconda). See the note [00-1_Softwares](https://github.com/ysBach/AO2019/blob/master/Notebooks/00-1_Softwares.md).

| (no note) | You will learn ``pathlib`` and other simple python grammars throughout the first few homework assignments. |                                                              |
| numpy     | Basic numpy to a bit advanced masking.                       | [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ysBach/AO2019/blob/master/Notebooks/python_prep/01-numpy.ipynb) |
| pandas    | Basic pandas, including iteration and grouping.              | [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ysBach/AO2019/blob/master/Notebooks/python_prep/02-pandas.ipynb) |



### References - Python in Astronomy

1. Matt Craig's [ccd as book](https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface)
   - Explains details about the astrnomical images, with worked examples. If you're not familiar with astrnomical data reduction, this is a good reference to start with.
2. Matt Craig's [reducer](https://reducer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - A simple Jupyter Notebook to reduce data, which the author used for his classes.
   - If you want, you may get ideas from this and use it in your own code.
3. [astropy tutorial](http://learn.astropy.org/)
   - I personally think the web is too laggy but some tutorials seem informative, e.g., [UVES spectrum analysis](http://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/UVES.html?highlight=filtertutorials).
4. The latest or stable official websites for each package, e.g., [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/), [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [ccdproc](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) themselves are good references.



### References - General Python

* Book _Think Python_ (see ``references/``)
  * HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
* [scipy lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/)
  * Only the chapter 1 is enough maybe.
* [Jake's _Python Data Science Handbook_](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/) 
  * This contains too much information for beginners... Maybe you can take a look at ``matplotlib`` part, etc, for fun.
* Other free books/lectures/materials are everywhere (e.g., google "python free")
* Or summarized at some places ([example](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/getting-started-with-python-a-list-of-free-resources/#ftag=CAD-00-10aag7f))
