# Python in Astronomy

In the previous note, I described the python references in general. Here I collect the references specific to astronomical studies.



1. Matt Craig's [ccd as book](https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface)
   * Explains details about the astrnomical images, with worked examples. If you're not familiar with astrnomical data reduction, this is a good reference to start with.
2. Matt Craig's [reducer](https://reducer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   * A simple Jupyter Notebook to reduce data, which the author used for his classes.
   * If you want, you may get ideas from this and use it in your own code.
3. [astropy tutorial](http://learn.astropy.org/)
   * I personally think the web is too laggy but some tutorials seem informative, e.g., [UVES spectrum analysis](http://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/UVES.html?highlight=filtertutorials).

4. The latest or stable official websites for each package, e.g., [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/), [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [ccdproc](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) themselves are good references.
