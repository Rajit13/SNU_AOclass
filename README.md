# AO2019
TA seminar notes for the AO classes in 2019 at SNU, Korea. All the lecture notes are primarily made by **Yoonsoo P. Bach**. I tried not to make typo, logically wrong statement, etc. If any problem is there in the note, that's solely my fault, so please be kind and let me know so that the notes can be updated.

- In 2019: Made this repo.
- In 2018: Made GitHub repo [link](https://github.com/ysBach/AO_LectureNotes) and [website](https://ysbach.github.io/AO_LectureNotes/). Many documents changed from ipynb to md.
- In 2017: Made GitHub repo [AO_2017](https://github.com/ysBach/AO_2017) and [website](https://ysbach.github.io/AO_2017/). 
- In 2016: No GitHub, but just MS Word-based lecture notes of PyRAF.

## TA Lecture Notes Outline

The following lecture notes *only* gives you idea how to use tools for data reduction. **You must be aware of what you are doing!** Identical procedure to the lecture note may give different results, depending on what you've done other than what I did when I make the notes.
