# SNU_AOclass
TA seminar notes for the AO classes from 2016-present at SNU, Korea. All the lecture notes are primarily made by **Yoonsoo P. Bach**. I tried not to make typo, logically wrong statement, etc. If any problem is there in the note, that's solely my fault, so please be kind and let me know so that the notes can be updated.
