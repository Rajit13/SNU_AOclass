# SNU_AOclass
TA seminar notes for the AO classes from 2016-present at SNU, Korea. All the lecture notes were primarily made by **Yoonsoo P. Bach**. I tried not to make typos, logically wrong statements, etc. If any problem is found in the note, that's solely my fault, so please be kind and let me know so that the notes can be updated.
