Solve [this](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/blob/master/Assignments/HW-python_03-pathlib.md).

Please submit as a single PDF file.



**NOTE**

While you are solving this, you may need some help from reference materials.

Look at the descriptions, especially references, at [here](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/tree/master/Notebooks/python_prep) (여기 설명된 참고자료들을 참고하시면 좋습니다)

Notebooks for numpy, pandas, and astropy may not be helpful for this homework, but it will be helpful for the next ones.



More basic **exercises** here (no need to submit answer sheet for these; 이건 제출하는 거 아닙니다! 참고하라고 둔 연습용 문제입니다):

(1) [Basic python](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/blob/master/Assignments/HW-python_01.md)

(2) [Basic pathlib](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/blob/master/Assignments/HW-python_02-pathlib.md)
