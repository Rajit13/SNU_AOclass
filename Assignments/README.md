## List of Homework

Order of HW assignments in 2020

### AO 1 (Spring)

1. [HW-software_01](HW-software_01.md) 
   * Installation of softwares, first basic usages of Slack, GitHub, SAO ds9, and python. 
   * [Sample solution](HW-software_01-sample_solution.md) I expect from students.
2. [HW-software_02](HW-software_02.md)
   * Usage
   * Interactive aperture photometry using SAO ds9
3. python basics
   1. [HW-python_01](HW-python_01.md) (not assigned to submit)
      * Real basics
   2. [HW-python_02-pathlib](HW-python_02-pathlib.md) (not assigned to submit)
      * Real basics
   3. [HW-python_03-pathlib](HW-python_03-pathlib.md)
      * Slightly more
4. python packages
   1. [HW-numpy_01](HW-numpy_01.md) (not assigned to submit)
      * Real basics
   2. [HW-numpy_02](HW-numpy_02.md) 
      * Slightly more
   3. [HW-pandas_01](HW-pandas_01.md) 
      * Simple usage of pandas
5. Astronomical data
   1.  [HW-astropy_01-fits](HW-astropy_01-fits.md)
      * First usage of ``astropy.io.fits`` and WCS.
   2. [HW-preproc_01_mkmaster](HW-preproc_01_mkmaster.md)
      * Making master calibration frames (bias/dark/flats).
      * Simple analysis of master calibration frames from SAO ds9
   3. [HW-preproc_02_BDFC.md](HW-preproc_02_BDFC.md)
      * Pre-processing of the science images from master calibration frames.
6. [HW-phot_01_apphot](HW-phot_01_apphot.md) 
   * Professional-level aperture photometry of 2005 UD data from SNU observatory (2018 Oct).
   * Undergraduate-level scientific analysis questions

7. [HW-obsphot_01](HW-obsphot_01.md)
   * An assignment to ask students to prepare for observational plan.
   * We couldn't proceed any real observation due to the COVID-19.
   * After giving feedbacks to students fro prof. and TA, students are asked to re-submit the answer sheet again within ~ 1-2 weeks.

There were mid-term and final exams. Normally we only have mid-term; final is replaced with students' group reports. This time, however, we couldn't conduct any students-led observations, so the final exam is introduced.

Please submit as a single PDF file.

Please open an issue at the repo if you find any typo/error.



**NOTE**

While you are solving this, you may need some help from reference materials.

Look at the descriptions, especially references, at here (여기 설명된 참고자료들을 참고하시면 좋습니다):

https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/tree/master/Notebooks/python_prep

Notebooks for numpy, pandas, and astropy may not be helpful for this homework, but it will be helpful for the next ones.



More basic **exercises** here (no need to submit answer sheet for these; 이건 제출하는 거 아닙니다! 참고하라고 둔 연습용 문제입니다):

(1) Basic python - https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/blob/master/Assignments/HW-python_01.md

(2) Basic pathlib - https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/blob/master/Assignments/HW-python_02-pathlib.md



**You have 15+ days till the submission due.**

**Please take your time for self study!!!**
