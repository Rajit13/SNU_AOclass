# Project 03

In this project, you will analyze the spectrum you obtained from the last project.



Please submit a simple report (including the code, showing *some* results, and giving simple explanations) which you think the TA can evaluate whether you finished the task appropriately. You may need to re-use these in your final report. 

You may refer to the presentation material from this repo (the first lecture material of the TA seminar).

You don't need to answer all the questions separately. But all these processes are essential to get the final result of this project. Thus, please regard these items (Problems) as checklist: You don't have to make an answer sheet like "answer to number 1: blahblah". Just make codes which work well, and present the results.

## Problems [60 pt]

1. Prepare the following twe spectra: [10 pt]
   1. Prepare an extracted 1-D spectrum of the standard star (wavelength, ADU/s [, error-bar])
      * If you have extracted the 1-D spectra of all the stars, you can use only one of them or properly combine them (consider the possible airmass difference!)
   2. Prepare an extracted 1-D spectrum of the target (wavelength, ADU/s [, error-bar])
2. Obtain the final spectrum [20 pt]
   * If you are doing absolute spectroscopy (nebulae and galaxies): You may have to find the catalog spectrum of the standard star, find the sense function which will convert the instrumental flux to the real physical unit. Then using this function to transform the target's instrumental SED to the physical unit.
   * If you are doing relative spectroscopy (planets and comets): You may just divide the target's spectrum with standard star's spectrum, if their wavelengths are identical.

3. Analyze it [30 pt].
   * <u>**You must have a clear scientific goal what you want to dig out from the data.**</u> You now have to think about the science what you can do. 
   * You can use continuum, absorption, or emission, and those parts can be, for example, fitted with certain functions. Some scientific purposes require different parameters: the flux values, flux ratios, spectral slope, line width, etc. Think what parameter you should get to achieve your scientific goal. Then obtain those parameters (error estimation is not a task in this undergraduate course, but you may consider). Give brief explanation whether these are expected or not, the importance of the value you obtained, etc. 
   * **This is a free, scientifically open question, so *you* have to construct your own questions, describe the ways to answer that questions, and answer them by yourself.**
